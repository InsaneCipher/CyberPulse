Over the past several months, UNC6040 has demonstrated repeated success in breaching networks by having its operators impersonate IT support personnel in convincing telephone-based social engineering engagements. This approach has proven particularly effective in tricking employees, often within English-speaking branches of multinational corporations, into actions that grant the attackers access or lead to the sharing of sensitive credentials, ultimately facilitating the theft of organization\u2019s Salesforce data.

The previous structure was an in-house item, before MITRE was a thing.\nWhen our menu was first created, there wasn\u2019t as much design planning done, which we suffered for later. It meant that over time, scaling and adding new tools became difficult for us.\nThe knock on effect was that this made it harder for you, the end-users, to discover new tools as similar tools with overlapping functions were in different places or missing entries.\nYes, seasoned professionals may not use the menu to start up items, using shortcuts such as super key and typing the tool name , or via a terminal window. We see the menu as a way to discover tools.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin in the setup was the fact that it was manually managed. Yes, all those entries were previously created by-hand (which also may explain a few things).\nAs a result, we had stopped adding new tools to the menu\u2026 until now.", "title": "Kali Linux - Kali Linux 2025.2 Release (Kali Menu Refresh, BloodHound CE & CARsenal)", "url": "https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2025-2-release/"}

Hence the delay.\n\nThere is a major change with this new Python version: installing third-party Python packages via pip is now strongly discouraged and disallowed by default . This change has been coming for a long time, we wrote about it 18 months ago already , been given little reminders in each release blog post since and we gave another push about it in the 2024.3 release blog post.

Then, everything was done through forums posting, including announcements, launching new projects like BackTrack, WHAX & Whoppix and their releases. They allowed like-minded individuals to create the foundation of a legacy that led to current day Kali.\n\nThe Internet and its culture has changed over time, which makes it difficult to put into perspective how influential forums were back then. For example, did you know that the WPS Pixie-Dust attack originated from a forum posting?\nNowadays a large majority of people communicate through real-time chat services, like Discord. However, if the discussion about the Pixie-Dust attack occurred through real-time chat, who knows how wide spread this information would become. We view real-time chat as a good place for quick conversation, sharing initial ideas or assistance, and forums for longer term form content, such as guides/tutorials, status updates, items which commonly come up that can be referred back to.

One can use dpkg --add-architecture i386 in order to then install i386 packages on their system via the package manager.

After the t64 transition finished up, it was straight into multiple other transitions: GCC 14, the glibc 2.40, and Python 3.12. \n\nThis last one is the most significant!

We have been busy fixing it all (weeks of work!), we are almost there, Python 3.12 will be the default in the next version of Kali - 2024.4.

We wrote about that a year ago already, we invite you to read that again if you are an avid user of pip. \n\nBut that will be for the next Kali release, 2024.4, due by the end of the year. In the meantime, this new release 2024.3 still has Python 3.11 as the default Python interpreter.", "title": "Kali Linux - Kali Linux 2024.3 Release (Multiple transitions)", "url": "https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2024-3-release/"}

We have some solid QA and automation for that to happen, and usually most packages just \u201croll in\u201d with minimal intervention from the Kali team. Our QA tells us when new packages from Debian break packages in Kali: in those cases packages are stuck in kali-dev (a development suite that is NOT meant to be used by end users), we fix it, and then they are allowed to roll in kali-rolling (which is what most end users use). This is part of what the Kali team does every day.\n\nDuring the last cycle, this routine was interrupted by a major change in Debian: the t64 transition. What is that? In short: t64 refers to 64-bit time_t type. For those not familiar with C, time_t is the type to store a Unix timestamp (quantity of seconds relative to the Unix Epoch), and the size for this type depends on the architecture. For those architectures that have a 32-bit time_t type, there will be an issue in the year 2038, as the maximum value possible will be reached, and the value will roll over beyond +2147483647 into negative values. The glibc page has all the technical details, for those who want to read more.\n\nTo prevent the Year 2038 issue, the size for the time_t type had to be changed to be 64-bit, on those architectures where it was 32-bit. For Kali Linux, that means the two 32-bit ARM architectures that we support: armhf and armel. These architectures are used mainly for ARM images (eg. Raspberry Pi) and a few NetHunter images. Note that the i386 architecture (ie. legacy PC) didn\u2019t change: this architecture still will have a 32-bit time_t type, and that will not change. Kali has always treated ARM platform as a first-class citizen.", "title": "Kali Linux - Kali Linux 2024.2 Release (t64, GNOME 46 & Community Packages)", "url": "https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-2024-2-release/"}

This is really beginner level, and we\u2019ll just reproduce the easiest findings that were reported in the initial disclosure. Nothing groundbreaking here, sorry ;)\n\nFirst thing first: we\u2019re going to need a Virtual Machine (or VM for short). The fastest is probably to just download a pre-built image from the Kali Linux download page, either the current 2024.1 release or the latest weekly image, at your preference.\n\nWhen the image is downloaded, let\u2019s start it. Don\u2019t know how? We have documentation for each type of image: VirtualBox, VMware and Hyper-V. For QEMU, its simple enough to create a new VM.\n\nNow our VM is up and running, so we\u2019re going to download and install a version of liblzma that contains the backdoor. Even though the package was pulled out of Linux distributions, it\u2019s still widely available on the Internet. For this how-to, we\u2019re going to get it from the Debian snapshot service.

It has already been patched in Debian, and therefore, Kali Linux.\n\nThe impact of this vulnerability affected Kali between March 26th to March 29th, during which time xz-utils 5.6.0-0.2 was available. If you updated your Kali installation on or after March 26th, but before March 29th, it is crucial to apply the latest updates today to address this issue.

Python\u2019s package manager. Suddenly it didn\u2019t work anymore, and it gave this error message instead:\n\nThis change came about without a notice, and judging by the early reports that we received, it was clear that it would impact many users. So we reverted it, and therefore pip install still works in Kali Linux these days. But not for long: when Python 3.12 hits Kali (around end of 2023 or beginning of 2024), it will stop working, this time for good. There\u2019s not much we can do about it, it\u2019s an upstream change, we have to go with the flow.\n\nSo why this change? Running pip install as root, in order to install Python packages system-wide, has never been a great idea. In a Linux distribution such as Kali, Python packages are already installed and managed via APT. If you bring in another package manager (pip in this case), it is likely to break packages and programs that were installed by APT, sooner or later. Then APT might break again what was installed by pip.

We also have updated the open-vm-tools package, and Kali\u2019s installer will automatically detect if you are installing under VMware and install the open-vm-tools-desktop package, which should allow you to change the resolution out of the box. As a reminder, this is still a preview from VMware, so there may be some rough edges. There is no extra documentation for this because the installation process is the same as VMWare on 64-bit and 32-bit Intel systems, just using the arm64 ISO.\n\nAs a reminder, virtual machines on Apple Silicon are still limited to arm64 architecture only.\n\nStarting Kali Linux 2021.4, the Samba client is now configured for Wide Compatibility so that it can connect to pretty much every Samba server out there, regardless of the version of the protocol in use.

This is done to help increase Kali\u2019s ability to talk to older, obsolete systems and servers that are still using these older protocols. This may potentially increase your options on available attack surfaces (if your target has these End of Life (EoL) services running, having then forgotten about them, what else could this uncover?). While this is not a configuration that would be good for a general purpose operating systems, this setting makes sense for Kali as it enables the user to engage and talk with more potential targets.\n\nThis setting is easy to modify via the command-line tool kali-tweaks though.

There are various reasons as to why, some of them are:\n\nWe reached out to Ampere to see if they would be able to help us out. We soon realised they have the same mindset as we do, ARM is the way forward. When developing Kali Linux, we treat ARM devices as \u201cfirst class citizens\u201d, just like we do with our \u201cdesktop\u201d images (amd64/i386). There are many advantages to ARM, such as using less power (which means they don\u2019t need cooling), lighter (handy when traveling to be on site or mailing devices to be a drop box) and cheaper devices (client doesn\u2019t have to return the device!). These make really small form factor devices - which for doing penetration testing or red team exercises on site, expands the possibilities of where to hide various devices (imagination is the only limitation). This is why we try and give the same user experience regardless of the platform you are using Kali on.\nThis is why we have pre-generated images and build scripts for as many different devices as possible\n\nAmpere has various community outreach programs, allowing as many different people as possible to interact with their hardware. The offerings are only expanding, and we now have a new permanent ARM home at Oregon State University\u2019s Open Source Lab where we are building all of our ARM packages, with plans to move our ARM OS images to be built here too in the near future.\n\nIt is never a fun task having to re-build systems, but we have noticed a very large advantage of doing so. There was a huge increase in performance from using Ampere\u2019s hardware. The change of environment was noticed straight away, without any changes to our configuration.

Windows is purely implemented in PowerShell (without powershell.exe!), and Linux/macOS is done in Python 3. Feature rich with various options to bypass various protections (and allows for easy modification for custom evasion), Empire is often a favourite for Command and Control (C2) activity.\n\nWe first had interaction with BC Security, when they were porting over the original Empire code base (v2.5) from Python 2 to 3 (as v2 had reached End of Life in January 2020). This is to help ensure Empire is is up-to-date and relevant with the modern software stack. They have also put in the time to increase empires features (growing on the original authors, that malware can be in PowerShell format). BC Security also have created their own \u201cGraphical User Interface (GUI)\u201d, Starkiller, to go along side Empire.\n\nUnder their sponsorware model, in order to get the latest version of Empire & Starkiller, you can sponsor to get the latest access, use Kali Linux, or wait 30 days until the source code becomes public.

Vulnerability scanners scan for vulnerabilities\u2013they are not magical exploit machines and should be one of many sources of information used in an assessment. Blindly running a vulnerability scanner against a target will almost certainly end in disappointment and woe, with dozens (or even hundreds) of low-level or uninformative results.\n\nThe main complaint we receive about OpenVAS (or any other vulnerability scanner) can be summarized as \u201cit\u2019s too slow and crashes and doesn\u2019t work and it\u2019s bad, and you should feel bad\u201d. In nearly every case, slowness and/or crashes are due to insufficient system resources. OpenVAS has tens of thousands of signatures and if you do not give your system enough resources, particularly RAM, you will find yourself in a world of misery. Some commercial vulnerability scanners require a minimum of 8GB of RAM and recommend even more.\n\nOpenVAS does not require anywhere near that amount of memory but the more you can provide it, the smoother your scanning system will run. For this post, our Kali virtual machine has 3 CPUs and 3GB of RAM, which is generally sufficient to scan small numbers of hosts at once.\n\nOpenVAS has many moving parts and setting it up manually can sometimes be a challenge. Fortunately, Kali contains an easy-to-use utility called \u2018openvas-setup\u2019 that takes care of setting up OpenVAS, downloading the signatures, and creating a password for the admin user.", "title": "Kali Linux - Configuring and Tuning OpenVAS in Kali Linux", "url": "https://www.kali.org/blog/configuring-and-tuning-openvas-in-kali-linux/"}

However, we want to take a moment to talk about how this relates to Kali Linux, from a defensive, testing, and detection standpoint.\n\nFrom a defensive standpoint, if you\u2019re keeping up with your Kali Linux rolling updates (via a simple \u201capt update && apt upgrade), you\u2019re already patched against this vulnerability thanks to patches in wpasupplicant and hostapd (both at 2.4-1.1). To be entirely clear: an updated version of Kali Linux is not vulnerable to this attack. You are keeping your Kali Linux system up-to-date, aren\u2019t you?\n\nWith your Kali system updated, there are also some steps you can take to test for this vulnerability on your access points. Mathy Vanhoef recently released a script that can be run from Kali Linux to test whether or not your access point (AP) is affected by CVE-2017-13082 or specifically the Key Reinstall in FT Handshake vulnerability found in 802.11r devices. The script requires that you authenticate to the access point, but bear in mind that it may incorrectly flag an AP as vulnerable due to \u201cbenign retransmissions of data frames\u201d.\n\n@Dragorn, the author of the amazing Kismet, has released lots of great information on the subject on his blog, including excellent info about detecting KRACK attacks using Kismet.

While it\u2019s certainly true that you will learn a lot, especially as you start out, building everything by hand will quickly devolve into tedium when you could be spending your time hacking or learning something new, preferably both.\n\nIn this post, we\u2019ll show you how you can safely add additional package repositories to your Kali installation, how to upgrade and downgrade them, and how to ensure all of these repositories live in harmony. APT is very powerful and will evaluate the available packages from all sources as a whole when it formulates its solutions.\n\nIf you want to make your future self happy, you should not directly edit /etc/apt/sources.list directly. For each new package repository you add to your system, create a new file with a descriptive name (like debian-unstable.list) under /etc/apt/sources.list.d/.

A passphrase is then used to encrypt the master key in turn. This process means that the passphrase is not directly coupled to the data. That is, if two sets of identical data are encrypted and the same passphrase used, the master keys remain unique to each set and cannot be swapped out. What this also means however, is that regardless of the passphrase used, if the master key is lost, recovering data is impossible. This process conveniently lends itself to being used as a nuke by deliberately wiping the keys.\n\nOur main purpose for introducing this feature in Kali Linux is to simplify the process of securely traveling with confidential client information. While \u201cLUKS Nuking\u201d your drive will result in an inaccessible disk, it is possible to backup your keyslots beforehand and restore them after the fact. What this allows us to do is to \u201cbrick\u201d our sensitive laptops before any travel, separate ourselves from the restoration keys (which we encrypt), and then \u201crestore\u201d them to the machines once back in a safe location. This way, if our hardware is lost or otherwise accessed midway through our travels, no one is able to restore the data on it, including ourselves.\n\nThere are other ways to delete your keyslots, however the advantage of the Nuke option is it is quick, easy, and does not require you to fully login to your Kali installation. If you maintain a backup of your header, you can Nuke the keyslots whenever you feel uncomfortable. Then conduct a restoration when you feel secure.\n\nLet\u2019s go through the motions of encrypting, backing up, destroying, and then restoring your data using Kali Linux. Start by downloading and installing Kali Linux 1.0.6 with Full Disk Encryption.

These scripts will replace the growing number of actual ARM image releases we have in order to reduce the exponentially growing amount of traffic we serve on each release. We will release a short blog post about how to use these scripts in the next few days.\n\nA couple of days ago, we demonstrated a cool patch for cryptsetup, which introduces a self destruction feature. The response to this post was overwhelmingly positive, as many people voted to see this feature included in Kali Linux. Therefore, we included this patch into our cryptsetup package yesterday, making the luksAddNuke options available to all Kali users by default. The patch is non-invasive and will not change anything for anyone that does not want to make use of it. No action is necessary if you currently use LUKS and don\u2019t want to utilize the key nuke feature. The updated cryptsetup package is present in Kali 1.0.6 by default. We\u2019d like to take a moment to thank everyone who participated in the poll for voicing their opinion.

Apart from a couple of path changes due to our new FHS compliance, our students should feel little difference between Kali and BackTrack.\n\nGone. Kaput. Kwisha. Dissipated. FSH compliance has removed the /pentest structure from our distribution. Although the /pentest directory tree was a signature of our previous distributions for many years, it always brought with it policy questions which could never be satisfactorily answered. For example, when does a tool go in /pentest, and when should it be placed in the $PATH? Where should a tool like \u201csqlmap\u201d be placed? Should it be in /pentest/web, or /pentest/database? With our new FSH compliant packages, there\u2019s no guesswork left. Everything is in the path and accessible directly, as it should be.", "title": "Kali Linux - Kali Linux 1.0 Release - Moto - The Birth of Kali Linux", "url": "https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-1-0-0-release/"}

However, there\u2019s much hidden magic in that last sentence.

We have some solid QA and automation for that to happen, and usually most packages just \u201croll in\u201d with minimal intervention from the Kali team. Our QA tells us when new packages from Debian break packages in Kali: in those cases packages are stuck in kali-dev (a development suite that is NOT meant to be used by end users), we fix it, and then they are allowed to roll in kali-rolling (which is what most end users use). This is part of what the Kali team does every day.\n\nDuring the last cycle, this routine was interrupted by a major change in Debian: the t64 transition. What is that? In short: t64 refers to 64-bit time_t type. For those not familiar with C, time_t is the type to store a Unix timestamp (quantity of seconds relative to the Unix Epoch), and the size for this type depends on the architecture. For those architectures that have a 32-bit time_t type, there will be an issue in the year 2038, as the maximum value possible will be reached, and the value will roll over beyond +2147483647 into negative values.

These make really small form factor devices - which for doing penetration testing or red team exercises on site, expands the possibilities of where to hide various devices (imagination is the only limitation). This is why we try and give the same user experience regardless of the platform you are using Kali on.\nThis is why we have pre-generated images and build scripts for as many different devices as possible\n\nAmpere has various community outreach programs, allowing as many different people as possible to interact with their hardware.

What this allows us to do is to \u201cbrick\u201d our sensitive laptops before any travel, separate ourselves from the restoration keys (which we encrypt), and then \u201crestore\u201d them to the machines once back in a safe location. This way, if our hardware is lost or otherwise accessed midway through our travels, no one is able to restore the data on it, including ourselves.\n\nThere are other ways to delete your keyslots, however the advantage of the Nuke option is it is quick, easy, and does not require you to fully login to your Kali installation. If you maintain a backup of your header, you can Nuke the keyslots whenever you feel uncomfortable.

The patch is non-invasive and will not change anything for anyone that does not want to make use of it. No action is necessary if you currently use LUKS and don\u2019t want to utilize the key nuke feature. The updated cryptsetup package is present in Kali 1.0.6 by default. We\u2019d like to take a moment to thank everyone who participated in the poll for voicing their opinion. This kind of feedback is very useful for us, giving us a better feel for the type of features to add in the future. In an upcoming blog post, we will take the opportunity to better explain this new feature and show you how to test it out.\n\nVMware Tools always lags behind new kernels, which always causes us headaches and this time is no exception.

In a way, it is quite special, because it represents a registry subtree simultaneously on disk and in memory, as opposed to most other common file formats. Documents, images, videos, etc. are generally designed to store data efficiently on disk, and they are subsequently parsed to and from different in-memory representations whenever they are read or written. This seems only natural, as offline storage and RAM come with different constraints and requirements. On disk, it is important that the data is packed as tightly as possible, while in memory, easy and efficient random access is typically prioritized. The regf format aims to bypass the reparsing step \u2013 likely to optimize the memory/disk synchronization process \u2013 and reconcile the two types of data encodings into a single one that is both relatively compact and easy to operate on at the same time. This explains, for instance, why hives don't natively support compression (but the clients are of course free to store compressed data in the registry). This unique approach comes with its own set of challenges, and has been a contributing factor in a number of historical vulnerabilities.", "title": "Google Project Zero - The Windows Registry Adventure #5: The regf file format", "url": "https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2024/12/the-windows-registry-adventure-5-regf.html"}

This is because they're designed to support a wide range of objects, not just those implemented in the service, but any other object compatible with being remoted. For example, if you wanted to expose an XML document across the client-server boundary, you could use a pre-existing COM or .NET library and return that object back to the client. By default when the object is returned it's marshaled by reference, which results in the object staying in the out-of-process server.", "title": "Google Project Zero - Windows Bug Class: Accessing Trapped COM Objects with IDispatch", "url": "https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2025/01/windows-bug-class-accessing-trapped-com.html"}
