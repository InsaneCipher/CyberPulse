Over the past several months, UNC6040 has demonstrated repeated success in breaching networks by having its operators impersonate IT support personnel in convincing telephone-based social engineering engagements. This approach has proven particularly effective in tricking employees, often within English-speaking branches of multinational corporations, into actions that grant the attackers access or lead to the sharing of sensitive credentials, ultimately facilitating the theft of organization\u2019s Salesforce data.

I will cover the design considerations that were made along with how the device operates.

That\u2019s correct (if Google translate didn\u2019t steer me wrong). While the Pwn2Own competition started in Vancouver in 2007, we always want to ensure we are reaching the right people with our choice of venue. Over the last few years, the OffensiveCon conference in Berlin has emerged as one of the best offensive-focused events of the year. And while CanSecWest has been a great host over the years, it became apparent that perhaps it was time to relocate our spring event to a new home. With that, we are happy to announce that the enterprise-focused Pwn2Own event will take place on May 15-17, 2025, at the OffensiveCon conference in Berlin, Germany. While this event is currently sold out, we do have tickets available for competitors, and we believe the conference will also open a few more tickets for the public, too. The conference sold out its first run of tickets in under six hours, so it should be a fantastic crowd of some of the best vulnerability researchers in the world.", "title": "Zero Day Initiative Blog - Announcing Pwn2Own Berlin and Introducing an AI Category", "url": "https://www.thezdi.com/blog/2025/2/24/announcing-pwn2own-berlin-2025"}
